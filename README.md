# The MouseFree To Do List

---

This is one of my first projects using **JavaScript** combined with **HTML5** and **CSS3**. It is a To Do List with the cool feature that you don't need the mouse to use it. It all can be done with the keyboard.

The goal is to make a page which is **100% navigable** with the keyboard.

### The action keys are:

|     KEYS      | ACTION                                                                                             | NAME                      | CODE                                                                   |
| :-----------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       A       | Shows all to do.                                                                                   | A, a                      | KeyA                                                                   |
|       C       | Shows completed to do.                                                                             | C, c                      | KeyC                                                                   |
|       U       | Shows uncompleted to do.                                                                           | U, u                      | KeyU                                                                   |
|       K       | Show/Hide key shortcuts.                                                                           | K, k                      | KeyK                                                                   |
| NUMBERS (1-9) | Changes the class of / deletes a specific todo (works in order).                                   | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | Digit1, Digit2, Digit3, Digit4, Digit5, Digit6, Digit7, Digit8, Digit9 |
|     ENTER     | Used to focus the input to add the todo.                                                           | Enter                     | Enter                                                                  |
|     ENTER     | Add todo to the list (once it's written).                                                          | Enter                     | Enter                                                                  |
|      ESC      | Deselects the text field/todo so you can navigate easily through the to do or the different menus. | Escape                    | Escape                                                                 |
