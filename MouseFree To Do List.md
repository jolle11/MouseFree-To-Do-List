# The MouseFree To Do List

---

This is one of my first projects using **JavaScript** combined with **HTML5** and **CSS3**. It is a To Do List with the cool feature that you don't need the mouse to use it. It all can be done with the keyboard.

The goal is to make a page which is **100% navigable** with the keyboard.

### The action keys are:

|      KEYS      | ACTION                                                                                             | KEYCODE            |
| :------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
|       A        | Shows all to do.                                                                                   | 65                 |
|       C        | Shows completed to do.                                                                             | 67                 |
|       U        | Shows uncompleted to do.                                                                           | 85                 |
|       D        | Shows deleted to do.                                                                               | 68                 |
| UP/DOWN ARROWS | Vertical navigation between to do.                                                                 | 38 (Up), 40 (Down) |
| NUMBERS (1-9)  | Selection of a specific todo (works in order).                                                     | 49-57              |
|    NUMBER 0    | Used to start writing.                                                                             | 48                 |
|     ENTER      | Add todo to the list (once it's written).                                                          | 13                 |
|     ENTER      | Complete a todo (when selected).                                                                   | 13                 |
|     DELETE     | Deletes a todo (when selected).                                                                    | 8                  |
|       E        | Edit a todo (when selected).                                                                       | 69                 |
|       R        | Reset a todo (when selected).                                                                      | 82                 |
|      ESC       | Deselects the text field/todo so you can navigate easily through the to do or the different menus. | 27                 |
