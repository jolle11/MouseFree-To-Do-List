# The MouseFree To Do List

---

This is one of my first projects using **JavaScript** combined with **HTML5** and **CSS3**. It is a To Do List with the cool feature that you don't need the mouse to use it. It all can be done with the keyboard.

The goal is to make a page which is **100% navigable** with the keyboard.

### The action keys are:

|      KEYS      | ACTION                                                                                             | NAME                      | CODE                                                                   |
